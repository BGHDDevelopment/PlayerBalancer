# PlayerBalancer

**Overview**

Welcome to the PlayerBalancer repo! This resource helps balance players between servers in your network. This resource also has an API which allows for you to take handling to the next level.
You can view the resource [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/55011/) and the addon resource [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/playerbalanceraddon.51220/).

**Issue Reporting/Support**

While you may report issues via the "Issues" tab I recommend putting them on our [Discord](https://bghddevelopment.com/discord) as it will be a faster response.

**Suggestions**

We do have a suggestions and feedback site [here](https://feedback.bghddevelopment.com) which is reviewed by project maintainers, but feel free to make a pull request to add cool features without posting there!
