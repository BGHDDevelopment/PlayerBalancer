    # Here you have an example of what you can do with the sections
    # The best way to understand this is to play around with it
    # You can have as many sections as you want, there is no limit here
    # If a section does not have a provider it will try to inherit it from the parent
    # When connecting to a server on a section while not being on it already, you get distributed
    # You can use regex to match a set of servers instead of adding each server individually

    # Providers you can use: (you can request more!)
    # NONE:                    Returns no server (no one will be able to connect to this section)
    # RANDOM:                  Returns a random server, generated by SecureRandom
    # RANDOM_LOWEST:           Returns a random server between the ones with the least players online
    # RANDOM_FILLER:           Returns a random server between the ones with the most players online that is not full
    # PROGRESSIVE:             Returns the first server that is not full
    # PROGRESSIVE_LOWEST:      Returns the first server with the least players online
    # PROGRESSIVE_FILLER:      Returns the first server with the most players online that is not full
    # EXTERNAL:                Returns the server calculated by a provider created by other plugin
